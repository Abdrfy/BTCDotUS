                    Bitcoin has proven itself as a store of value protocol. Stacks is on a mission to prove that Bitcoin can also be the bedrock of the user owned internet. Stacks brings scalable
                    transactions and expressive smart contracts to Bitcoin, putting Bitcoinâ€™s $1T capital to work.

                    .BTC domains are registered through a smart contract on Stacks, secured by Bitcoin. This smart contract implements a decentralized name registry written in Clarity lang. Ownership
                    of every .BTC name is represented in a hash of the Bitcoin blockchain. Instead of spamming the bitcoin blockchain with name registrations, thousands of Stacks transactions settle
                    in a single transaction on the bitcoin blockchain.
